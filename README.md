# simple_pyper
A open-source command line tool software to use python script easily! Just make it your personal convinent toolbox.

Can download and try it with pip:

```shell
pip install simple-pyper
```

and then in terminal:

```shell
pyper
```

to enter the tool

# How to start?
Maybe you can try the script examples in ./pipelines file fold. There are (currently):
- tsv file to csv file covertor
- csv file to tsv file convertor
- draw a histgram based on csv or tsv file
- a plus calculator

Simple scripts! But I hope this can inspire you to contribute to this project, just by make a simple but useful script! Let's try simple-pyper!

The scripts and pipelines are in another repo: https://github.com/CHENyiru3/scripts_for_sp. I don't know how to let you download them sperately, so I just creat another repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CHENyiru3/scripts_for_sp
```

And then 'inspect' the pipelines fold to start.

# Future
1. I will complete the document firstly. Because now you may even don't now what the simple-pyper is.
2. I am a student who is learning to build a well-structured software. Current code is ugly (yeah I know! No encapsulation!) But I will try to improve it, and I hope you can involved in this project!
3. Add more features (more user-friendly)
4. Application-like UI? Super-easy tool!
